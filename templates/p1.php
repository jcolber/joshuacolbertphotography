                    <p>All of my photography is printed on archival quality photo paper with a lustre finish, and is 
                    thoughtfully packaged to ensure its arrival in perfect condition. Each print is hand checked to 
                    ensure it meets my expectations and is personally signed before shipment.
                    Aluminum prints fuse the ink onto aluminum sheets for prints that are water, scratch 
                    and UV resistant, easy to hang and simply stunning. Its reflective quality makes 
                    the photos pop with color and high detail. Please allow 2-3 weeks for aluminum prints.</p><br><br>
