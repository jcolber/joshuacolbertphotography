                    <h2>Sundial Peak is one of the best hikes Utah has to offer for sure. It's featured in magazines, guide books, and maps of the state, and is worth the hike to get there.
                        My favorite part of this hike is where this photograph was taken because the color of the rocks and how green everything is around you. Not too much further than 
                        this picture was taken, you reach Lake Blanche, which is a great lake to sit by and watch fish eat bugs off the surface. In the background is Mt. Superior, and Monte Cristo, 
                        which are also fun hikes to do. If you're feeling like an adventure, start in Little Cottonwood and hit the peaks, and then hike down to Big Cottonwood Canyon. From the top 
                        the looks are deceiving because the lake doesn't look too far, but it is a long long way to go. Waterfalls, flowers, marsh areas, cliffs, and water holes into the earth can be seen 
                        if you're willing to walk it, but if not, you can see some more pictures <a href="stories-through-pictures.html">here.</a>
                    </h2><br>
                        <p>All of my photography is printed on archival quality photo paper with a lustre finish, and is 
                        thoughtfully packaged to ensure its arrival in perfect condition. Each print is hand checked to 
                        ensure it meets my expectations and is personally signed before shipment.<br><br>
