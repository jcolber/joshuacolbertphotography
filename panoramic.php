                        <h2>Sundial Peak is one of the best hikes Utah has to offer for sure. It's featured in magazines, guide books, and maps of the state, and is worth the hike to get there.
                            My favorite part of this hike is where this photograph was taken because the color of the rocks and how green everything is around you. Not too much further than 
                            this picture was taken, you reach Lake Blanche, which is a great lake to sit by and watch fish eat bugs off the surface. In the background is Mt. Superior, and Monte Cristo, 
                            which are also fun hikes to do. If you're feeling like an adventure, start in Little Cottonwood and hit the peaks, and then hike down to Big Cottonwood Canyon. From the top 
                            the looks are deceiving because the lake doesn't look too far, but it is a long long way to go. Waterfalls, flowers, marsh areas, cliffs, and water holes into the earth can be seen 
                            if you're willing to walk it, but if not, you can see some more pictures <a href="stories-through-pictures.html">here.</a>

                            hike, but it was definitely worth it. Mountain goats hanging out at the top, feeding chipmunks on the peak, and

                            sun is setting. The first time I tried hiking to the top of Frary Peak, we didn't have enough water for two people
                            and had to turn around quite away up the trail to go get water. The both of us were getting delirious and could 
                            hardly walk without stumbling. On this trip however, we brought water and made it to the top and got to see all the
                            lights from the city and even saw a big horned sheep or ram as you might know it. One of my favorite pictures I've 
                            ever taken was also on this hike, and you can find it on <a href="#">this</a> page. Look for the dead tree and sunset, and
                            you'll see what makes it a neat picture.

                            If I lived there and had the day off, I would probably be doing the same thing. We went to a bunch of
