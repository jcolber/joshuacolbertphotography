            <p>This was one of my favorite hikes, and it wasn't really planned... It started on a Sunday and Chris McClung finally woke up around 11 and we decided to go hike somewhere. So I pulled out my map and started looking at areas and we decided to drive up Little Cottonwood checking out areas that looked "doable" without ever checking for a legit trail. Well the peak we picked was Mt. Superior apparently via the Hellgate Avalanche zone. We pulled over and looked it over for a minute before saying, "that doens't look too bad". </p>

            <p>So we went for it. We climbed straight up the side without any sort of trail, just keeping an eye on the top and stopping every couple hundred feet because of the intense leg burner of a route we were on.</p>
